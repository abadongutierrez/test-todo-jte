- [JTE](https://jte.gg/)
- [Spring ViewComponents](https://github.com/tschuehly/spring-view-component)
- [HTMX](https://htmx.org/)

This project is replicating the ToDo App created in: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/build-a-todo-app-from-scratch-with-reactjs/

## Run the app

NOTE: Maybe you will need to modify `gradlew` so it can be executed (`chmod 744 gradlew`)

Then go to: `http://localhost:8080/todo`
